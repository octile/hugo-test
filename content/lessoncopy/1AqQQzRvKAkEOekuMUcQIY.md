The Contentful web app, on the other hand, is writing content by connecting to the Content Mangement API:\n\n![minimal contentful setup](//images.contentful.com/qz0n5cdakyl9/3z7ErmBLIccwQkQkuEY0w4/792f81c7d92d195abf89ea936071d1f6/webapp-contentful-example-app.svg)\n\nThe Contentful web app is a single page application created by Contentful and assists with common content management tasks. The Contentful web app provides:\n\n-  An interface for editors to write content\n- An interface for developers to configure a space, model data, define roles and permissions, and set up webhook notifications\n\nAs mentioned, the Contentful web app is a client that uses the Content Management API. Therefore, you could replicate the functionality that the Contentful web app provides by making an API call. This is a powerful aspect of an API-first design because it helps you to connect Contentful to third-party systems."
