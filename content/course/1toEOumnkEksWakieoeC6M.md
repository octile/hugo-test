description = "This course helps you understand the basics behind Contentful. It contains modules that introduce you to core concepts and how your app consumes content from Contentful. This content is pulled from Contentful APIs using a Contentful SDK.\n\nThe user interface of this example app is unique to this application and is _not_ a template. This is intentional, and it touches an aspect of Contentful's API-first approach that we'll discuss later.\n\nThe Hello Contentful course covers the following topics:\n\n- **Contentful's APIs**: Basic components of Contentful\n- **Content modelling**: How content is structured within Contentful\n- **Authoring content**: Connecting this application to Contentful's web app"
